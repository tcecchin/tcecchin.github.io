     <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20pt;">My name is Tessa Cecchin but you can just call me Tessa! I am finishing my fourth and final year at Mizzou with an expected graduation in May 2024. I am pursuing a degree in Environmental Science with an emphasis in Education and Outreach, a minor in Plant Sciences, and a certificate in Sustainability. I received my highschool diploma from York Community High School in Elmhurst, IL, a west suburb of Chicago, IL. I am currently a member of the MU Forestry Club, the MU Horticulture Club, Planned Parenthood Advocates at Mizzou (PPAM) club, and Sigma Kappa sorority and am currently working at a restaurant in the downtown Columbia, MO area.</p>

     <blockquote>My favorite quote is 
     <strong>“Be the change you wish to see in the world”</strong> 
        <em>- Mahatma Gandhi.</em>
     I admire this quote because I do believe that leading by example is one of the most influential things a person can do. I affirm with the ideology that if you want change, change it within yourself and educate others along the way.
