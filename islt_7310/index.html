    <header><h1>Dear reader,</h1></header>
    <main><p>My name is Tessa Cecchin and I am a senior in my fourth year at the University of Missouri in Columbia. I am currently taking a class on website design so this is my first project! This website will give you a glimpse into my life including my academic career, personal projects, and some things I try to live my life by! I hope I can show you more on the important work being done in our world with the resources provided on this website. During my academic career, I graduated from York High School in Elmhurst, IL in 2016, and am expected to graduate from the University of Missouri in May of 2024 with a Bachelors in Environmental Science, Minor in Plant Sciences, and a Certificate in Sustainability. Some personal projects of mine include crocheting clothes and accessories, landscaping my backyard, and playing the piano. Some things I try to live my life by include “Purchases are an investment”, “I am the luckiest person in the world syndrome”, and “Be the change you wish to see in the world”.
